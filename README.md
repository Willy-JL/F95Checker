## How to use:

#### How to use the GUI:
 - Add games by pasting the game thread link in the input box and clicking "Add"
 - Remove games with the edit mode button on the right
 - Check for updates with the HUGE "Refresh!" button
 - If a game was updated you will get a messagebox telling you
 - Click on a game's name to view it's changelog
 - Open a game by clicking the play button on the left
 - Right click the play button to open the install folder of the game
 - Open a webpage by clicking the "arrow square thingy" on the right
 - Tick the "download" checkbox for games you have installed and then the played checkbox (just left of the installed one) if you played it
 - Change settings on the right under the "Refresh!" button

#### How to use BG Mode:
 - Switch to BG Mode from GUI
 - Tool will minimize to tray
 - Tool refreshes periodically, you can configure how often this happens in the GUI
 - If something happens (any time you would get a popup in GUI Mode) you will get a standard notification
 - You can pause the auto refreshing from the system tray icon (right click)
 - Double click on the tray icon to bring back up GUI Mode
 - Right clicking on the tray icon you can also: view alerts, view inbox, see when the next refresh will happen, manually refresh and exit the tool

#### What the settings do:
 - **Open Pages as Saved HTML**: when you open a webpage it will be first downloaded and then opened as an html file; this is useful because it allows you to view links and spoilers without logging in on the browser
 - **Max Retries per Request**: how many times a web request to F95Zone will be retried before failing
 - **Auto Sort**: how the game list will get sorted
 - **BG Refresh Interval (min)**: interval between background mode refreshes in minutes


## How it works:
First of all this script was written in Python 3.8.8, makes use of the aiohttp package to make HTTP requests and runs on the PyQt5 window engine, assisted by qasync to work with asyncio loops.
 - Creates a session to keep cookies alive through search requests.
 - Logs into an account (this is necessary to be able to search for games since links change upon updates).
 - Searches for each game individually with a quicksearch request.
 - Grabs the version from the game title.
 - Compares the version number with the one from the previously saved data.
 - If a game was updated, requests the game thread and identifies the changelog and status.


## Planned Features Tracker:

#### Next Update:
 - Improve Linux support

#### Soon:
 - Add multiple games with one add
 - Edit name upon not found error
 - Notes button to add comments to a certain game
 - Filter games based on status and other criteria

#### Future:

 - Top / bottom of list shortcuts
 - Letter shortcuts

#### Far Future:
 - Possibly Mac support, if there's demand for it

   - Last but not least, moved config storage to User's appdata folder
   - If you're coming from a previous installation (i swear this is the last time, the autoupdater will do it in the future for you) i suggest you:
     - Download the new version
     - Copy your old "config.ini" to the new folder
     - Delete your old folder
     - Run "F95Checker.pyw"
   - I kinda rushed this update so i might have missed something, please tell me if you have any issues!

   - If you're coming from 6.5:
     - replace "Background.pyw"

</details>
<details>
  <summary>v6.5</summary>

   - BACKGROUND MODE!
     - Set up the interval in the normal GUI settings
     - When a game is updated you get a notification right on your desktop

     - replace "requirements.txt"

</details>
<details>
  <summary>v6.4</summary>

   - Open Pages as Saved HTML now has all clickable links and items working (they take you to the online page so you will not be logged in)
   - Open Pages as Saved HTML now also loads the compressed page (if available) as an html so you can see the compressed download links without having to log in
   - If you're coming from 6.1 or newer simply replace "F95Checker.pyw"; otherwise please perform a clean install
</details>
<details>
  <summary>v6.3</summary>

   - Under the hood update!
   - Completely changed how game data gets stored: now everything is stored in "config.ini" (feel free to delete the .txt files from the Data folder if you have any)
   - Now the tool also stores the game link, the time you added it to the list and the last time it was updated (and also a placeholder "completed" value for the future)
   - What does this mean for you? Not much... now you can use the Open buttons without refreshing first and that's about it
   - What does this mean for the tool's (very near) future? Sorting options are coming! stay tuned...
   - Also changed how the changelog works: now it shows a fixed number of 69 lines of the whole changelog, instead of trying to identify the exact changes; this makes the changelog a whole lot more reliable and also easier to manage for me; also the changelog gets fetched whenever the installed checkbox is not ticked
   - If you're coming from 6.1 or newer simply replace "F95Checker.pyw"; otherwise please perform a clean install
</details>

   - Removed "Export Updated List to File" and "Extra Size" options

## Disclaimer:
I know you might be skeptical about inserting your account credentials into some random dude's program, and I totally agree with you if you are, but you can read through the code and if you can understand anything about coding (not even that, python is really similar to english) you will see that this doesn't do anything harmful. If you still aren't sure you can create a second account just for this program.


## Contributing:
Please do! I poured my heart and soul into this tool and hearing suggestions or getting help or pointer with the code really helps!
