If you want this for Mac let me know


## Installation:
The tool comes bundled with both windows EXE and python scripts, so you have two ways to install:

#### Windows EXE:
 - Download below and extract
 - Double-click `F95Checker.exe` when you want to use the tool
#### Python script (Linux):
 - Install Python ( 3.9.5 preferably )
 - Download below and extract
 - Install requirements (`pip3 install --upgrade -r requirements_linux.txt`)
 - Run "F95Checker.py" with Python (`python3 F95Checker.py`) or use `F95Checker.sh`

## How to use:

#### How to use the GUI:
 - Add games by pasting the game thread link in the input box and clicking "Add"
 - Remove games with the edit mode button on the right
 - Check for updates with the HUGE "Refresh!" button
 - If a game was updated you will get a messagebox telling you
 - Click on a game's name to view it's changelog or add some notes to it
 - Open a game by clicking the play button on the left
 - Right click the play button to open the install folder of the game
 - Open a webpage by clicking the "arrow square thingy" on the right
 - Tick the "download" checkbox for games you have installed and then the played checkbox (just left of the installed one) if you played it
 - Change settings on the right under the "Refresh!" button

#### How to use BG Mode:
 - Switch to BG Mode from GUI
 - Tool will minimize to tray
 - Tool refreshes periodically, you can configure how often this happens in the GUI
 - If something happens (any time you would get a popup in GUI Mode) you will get a standard notification
 - You can pause the auto refreshing from the system tray icon (right click)
 - Double click on the tray icon to bring back up GUI Mode
 - Right clicking on the tray icon you can also: view alerts, view inbox, see when the next refresh will happen, manually refresh and exit the tool

#### What the settings do:
 - **Open Pages as Saved HTML**: when you open a webpage it will be first downloaded and then opened as an html file; this is useful because it allows you to view links and spoilers without logging in on the browser
 - **Refresh Completed Games**: when this is **disabled** completed games will not be checked, meaning that refreshing will be faster but of course you might miss out on smaller hotfixes or expansions to those games
 - **Auto Sort**: how the game list will get sorted
 - **Max Retries per Request**: how many times a web request to F95Zone will be retried before failing
 - **Max Threads per Request**: how many threads will be used to refresh, generally speaking should be same or higher than the count of games you have; just leaving it at 100 will let it adjust as needed
 - **BG Refresh Interval (min)**: interval between background mode refreshes in minutes


## How it works:
First of all this script was written in Python 3 and built with Python 3.9.5, makes use of the aiohttp package to make HTTP requests and runs on the PyQt5 window engine, assisted by qasync to work with asyncio loops.
 - Creates a session to keep cookies alive through search requests.
 - Logs into an account (this is necessary to view spoilers / link and to check alerts / inbox).
 - Checks if the link to a game changed (usually the version tag in the thread title changes).
 - If the link changed it loads the thread and grabs new game info.
 - If 1 game or more were updated it notifies you with a messagebox.


## Planned Features Tracker:

#### Soon:
 - Huh... looks like I've run out of feature ideas... hit me up in the replies if you want to suggest something!

#### Far Future:
 - Possibly Mac support, if there's demand for it

   - Fixed an issue with a special character ("•") that would not be saved and cause the changelog fetcher to crash; they get replaced with "-" now

   - Fixed installed checkboxes behavior

   - Last but not least, moved config storage to User's appdata folder
   - If you're coming from a previous installation (i swear this is the last time, the autoupdater will do it in the future for you) i suggest you:
     - Download the new version
     - Copy your old "config.ini" to the new folder
     - Delete your old folder
     - Run "F95Checker.pyw"
   - I kinda rushed this update so i might have missed something, please tell me if you have any issues!
</details>
<details>

   - If you're coming from 6.5:
     - replace "Background.pyw"

     - add the missing new files from the "Data" folder
   - If you're coming from 6.1 or newer do all the above and also:
     - replace "requirements.txt"
     - run "install.bat"
   - otherwise please perform a clean install
   - Please report any bugs you find with background mode, I didn't have much time to test it
   - This might be one of the last updates for a while (as in a few months) as I feel like I have reached a good spot with the tool and school starts next week... dont worry though sorting options will come at some point
</details>
<details>
  <summary>v6.5</summary>

   - BACKGROUND MODE!
     - Set up the interval in the normal GUI settings
     - When a game is updated you get a notification right on your desktop
   - Fixed Set GUI Accent Color
   - Fixed Open Pages as Saved HTML
   - If you're coming from 6.1 or newer:
     - copy "Background.pyw"
     - replace "F95Checker.pyw"
     - replace the whole "Data" folder
     - replace "requirements.txt"
     - run "install.bat"
   - otherwise please perform a clean install
   - EDIT (Sept 10 2020, 9 PM EST): updated the 6.5 download with a fixed install.bat that works with pip > 2.1. if you had issues with install.bat they should be fixed now.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>v6.4</summary>

   - Open Pages as Saved HTML now has all clickable links and items working (they take you to the online page so you will not be logged in)
   - Open Pages as Saved HTML now also loads the compressed page (if available) as an html so you can see the compressed download links without having to log in
   - If you're coming from 6.1 or newer simply replace "F95Checker.pyw"; otherwise please perform a clean install
</details>
<details>
  <summary>v6.3</summary>

   - Under the hood update!
   - Completely changed how game data gets stored: now everything is stored in "config.ini" (feel free to delete the .txt files from the Data folder if you have any)
   - Now the tool also stores the game link, the time you added it to the list and the last time it was updated (and also a placeholder "completed" value for the future)
   - What does this mean for you? Not much... now you can use the Open buttons without refreshing first and that's about it
   - What does this mean for the tool's (very near) future? Sorting options are coming! stay tuned...
   - Also changed how the changelog works: now it shows a fixed number of 69 lines of the whole changelog, instead of trying to identify the exact changes; this makes the changelog a whole lot more reliable and also easier to manage for me; also the changelog gets fetched whenever the installed checkbox is not ticked
   - If you're coming from 6.1 or newer simply replace "F95Checker.pyw"; otherwise please perform a clean install
</details>
<details>
  <summary>v6.2h1</summary>

   - Fixed name highlighting with installed checkboxes
   - Fixed "Open Pages as Saved HTML", now the temporary html file gets stored in C:\Windows\Temp and gets deleted a few seconds later; please let me know if you encounter issues with permissions

  <summary>v6.2</summary>

   - Resizable GUI! a little kinda a lot laggy... yeah... thats not on me, it's the window engine that is 30 years old... anyway it still works perfectly and the window size persists through restarts; thanks abada25!
   - Games not installed now always have their name highlighted
   - Removed "Export Updated List to File" and "Extra Size" options
   - Fixed a few minor bugs
   - If you're coming from 6.1 simply replace "F95Checker.pyw"; otherwise please perform a clean install
   - Sorry DarK x Duke i couldn't quite fix the issue with the spaces... i know the problem but the normal fix doesn't seem to work... i'll look more into it tomorrow :D
   - EDIT: well it seems that my attempt at fixing the issue with open saved html broke it completely instead... im sorry guys im really tired right now ill fix it tomorrow

## Disclaimer:
I know you might be skeptical about inserting your account credentials into some random dude's program, and I totally agree with you if you are, but you can read through the code and if you can understand anything about coding (not even that, python is really similar to english) you will see that this doesn't do anything harmful. If you still aren't sure you can create a second account just for this program.


## Contributing:
Please do! I poured my heart and soul into this tool and hearing suggestions or getting help or pointer with the code really helps!
