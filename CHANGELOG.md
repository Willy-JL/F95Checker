### Updated:
- Refresh process with F95Checker Cache API (#180 #184 #187 #188 by @Willy-JL):
  - Due to strain this tool was causing on F95zone servers they now have many ratelimits which make it unfeasible to continue as before
  - From now on F95Checker will not get game info directly from F95zone, but from a middleman F95Checker Cache API
  - Check the README/OP for more info, but basically:
    - No longer required to login with an F95zone account to use F95Checker, except for:
      - Regular, Masked and Donor DDL downloads
      - Notification checking
      - Importing bookmarked/watched threads
      - Opening webpages if you enabled Browser > Download pages
    - Refreshing is MUCH faster, semantics of "fast/full refresh" changed (check README/OP)
    - Regular download links are not publicly available, thus they now work similarly to masked download links
    - In rare occasions some updates/changes may be slightly slower to be detected and this is out of your control
  - Workers setting renamed to Connections, has different meaning, and max is now 10
  - Bunch of other things tweaked slightly to fit this new paradigm
- Finished/Played checkbox behavior (by @Willy-JL):
  - Renamed from Played to Finished as its semantics changed
  - Now remembers what version you marked as finished
  - Finished checkbox is relative to Installed checkbox:
    - Marking as finished saves the currently installed version as the one you finished
    - If you mark as finished when you don't have the latest version installed, Finished checkbox will be half-set when you mark a new version as installed
  - Basically reflects the previous behavior of Installed checkbox, but now for Finished checkbox too
  - Check README/OP FAQ for more info
- Redesigned grid/kanban cells, more compact data and nicer to look at (by @Willy-JL)

### Removed:

- Parser processes option and multiprocessing logic are gone, as parsing is no longer done clientside

### Known Issues:
- Sorting can be sporadically break/change with some actions, seems to be memory corruption inside (py)imgui, re-launch to fix it or change sorting manually
- MacOS webview in frozen binaries remains blank, run from source instead
