### Added:
- ASTC Image Compression option:
  - Compresses images for instantaneous load times (after first compression which is slower)
  - Potentially less VRAM usage, overall slightly less disk usage on average (if ASTC Replace is also enabled, otherwise files are duplicated)
  - Some GPUs may not be compatible, some others may render images less efficiently like this
- Unload Images Off-screen option:
  - Saves a lot of VRAM usage by unloading images not currently shown
  - Only recommended together with ASTC Image Compression, otherwise it is very slow
