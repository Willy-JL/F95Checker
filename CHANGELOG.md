### Added:
- Image Texture Compression (`(ASTC or BC7) + ZSTD`) option (#212 by @Willy-JL):
  - Compresses images for instantaneous load times (after first compression which is slower)
  - Less VRAM usage, and potentially less disk usage, depending on configuration and GPU support
  - Check the hover info in settings section for details on trade-offs
- Unload Images Off-screen option (#212 by @Willy-JL):
  - Saves a lot of VRAM usage by unloading images not currently shown
  - Works best together with Tex Compress, so image load times are less noticeable
- Play GIFs and Play GIFs Unfocused options (#212 by @Willy-JL):
  - Saves a lot of VRAM if completely disabled, no GIFs play and only first frame is loaded
  - Saves CPU/GPU usage by redrawing less if disabled when unfocused, but still uses same VRAM

### Updated:
- New notification system with buttons and better platform support, option to include banner image in update notifs (#220 by @Willy-JL)
